 CS50 Finance — Stock Trading Web App

This project is my implementation of CS50x Problem Set 9: Finance. It’s a full-stack web application where users can register, log in, look up real-time stock prices, buy and sell shares, and track their portfolio and transaction history. The app is built using Flask, SQLite, Python, and the IEX API.

 Buying & Selling Stocks

Real-time stock lookup, buy/sell transactions, validation to prevent invalid trades, and instant balance updates.

 Portfolio Dashboard

Displays current holdings, stock values, and remaining cash based on real-time prices.

 Transaction History

Shows every buy and sell with timestamps and share quantities.
